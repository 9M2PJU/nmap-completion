nmap-completion

https://github.com/bonsaiviking/nmap-completion

A bash-completion script for Nmap (http://www.nmap.org). Currently supporting
version 5.51 of Nmap.

FEATURES

* tab-complete options with both short and long versions
* tab-complete time options with h, m, s, ms
* tab-complete script names and categories
* tab-complete timing options with names: "paranoid," "insane," etc.
* tab-complete interface names for -e

INSTALLING

This script will work in any location that is "sourced" by Bash on startup.
Distributions (like Ubuntu) that package bash-completion separately may have a
directory for these scripts. On Ubuntu, the directory is 
/etc/bash_completion.d/. In this case, just copy the file ./nmap into that
directory and restart Bash.

If you have problems, check that /etc/bash_completion is sourced from your
~/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc. On Backtrack, for instance, the code for this
is commented out.

For other distributions, or as a safe fallback, copy the contents of ./nmap
into your ~/.bashrc file. Some features (like -e interface name completion) may
not work with this method.

KNOWN ISSUES

o Completion for -e uses bash-completion's _available_interfaces function, which
  uses Perl-style named character classes in an awk script. GNU awk (gawk)
  handles this just fine, but other awks may not. Specifically, Ubuntu Linux
  uses mawk to provide awk, which causes this to fail. Bug report for
  bash-completion under Ubuntu filed at
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bash-completion/+bug/778679

o --spoof-mac adds single quotes ('') to complete vendor names, which may be
  confusing, and break in some cases (if the vendor name contains a single
  quote, for instance). Also, this interacts poorly with the sudo completion
  script, rendering it useless (since root privilege is needed to spoof your
  MAC address). Note that the list of vendor names is quite long. Use with
  caution.

o The --datadir option changes NMAPDIR for Nmap, but the completion script isn't
  smart enough to know about it. Don't expect it to tab-complete script names
  in odd directories. However, if you export the $NMAPDIR environment variable,
  both Nmap and nmap-completion will use it properly.
